# Development Proposal: Daikibo Factory Monitoring Dashboard

## 1. Overview

This proposal outlines the development of a comprehensive private dashboard solution for Daikibo Corporation to monitor the health status of 36 machines across their 4 manufacturing facilities. The system will provide real-time telemetry visualization, historical data analysis, and intuitive status monitoring capabilities accessible exclusively within the client's secure intranet environment.

The dashboard will serve as a centralized monitoring hub, enabling operations teams to quickly identify machine issues, track performance trends, and maintain optimal factory efficiency. The solution will integrate seamlessly with Daikibo's existing infrastructure and authentication systems, ensuring secure access while maintaining operational continuity.

## 2. Scope

The project encompasses the following core functionalities:

### Core Features:
- **Real-time Machine Status Monitoring**: Live display of health status for all 36 machines (9 machines Ã— 4 factories)
- **Hierarchical Data Organization**: Factory-level and device-level categorization with collapsible/expandable views
- **Historical Status Tracking**: Timeline view of machine status changes and performance history
- **Intranet-Only Access**: Secure deployment within client's internal network infrastructure
- **Single Sign-On Integration**: Authentication synchronized with existing internal authentication server
- **Responsive Dashboard Interface**: Single-page application optimized for various screen sizes

### Technical Specifications:
- **Authentication System**: Integration with company-wide Active Directory/LDAP authentication
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and status indicators for machine health metrics
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live telemetry data streaming
- **Database Integration**: Connection to existing telemetry data sources
- **Security Compliance**: Implementation of internal security protocols and access controls
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data loading and caching mechanisms

### User Interface Components:
- Factory overview grid with status summary
- Expandable factory sections showing individual machines
- Machine detail panels with historical data graphs
- Alert notification system for critical status changes
- Search and filter functionality for quick machine location
